# Enhanced Gemini RAG App

The Enhanced Gemini RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) App is a Streamlit application designed to improve information retrieval and content generation using the Gemini API. This app scrapes content from a specified URL, processes it into manageable chunks, and allows users to ask questions to retrieve relevant information. It includes features like chunk size customization, hybrid search, caching, and user feedback.

## Features

- **Chunk Size and Overlap Customization**: Specify chunk size and overlap for optimized content processing.
- **Multiple Embedding Models**: Choose from various embedding models.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword-based and semantic search for accurate context retrieval.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Cache embeddings to improve response times.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Provide feedback on the answers.
- **Context Window Selection**: Select multiple relevant chunks for context.
- **Source Attribution**: References to source chunks in generated answers.
- **Error Handling and Fallbacks**: Graceful management of API errors.
- **Content Update Functionality**: Dynamically update the knowledge base.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improved user experience with a central layout.
- **Multi-language Support**: Ready for future implementation.
- **Security Measures**: Basic structure in place for future implementation.
- **Analytics and Logging**: Basic structure in place for future implementation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient chunk processing and caching.
- **Support for Different Content Types**: Ready for future extension.
- **Conversation History**: Ready for future implementation.
- **Explainability Features**: Provides context used for generating answers.
- **Continuous Learning**: Ready for future updates and fine-tuning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-gemini-rag-app.git
    cd enhanced-gemini-rag-app
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Enter your Gemini API Key**: Provide your Gemini API key for authentication.
2. **Enter the URL to Scrape**: Input the URL of the webpage you want to scrape and process.
3. **Specify Chunk Size and Overlap**: Customize the chunk size and overlap for content processing.
4. **Select Embedding Model**: Choose from available embedding models.
5. **Scrape and Process**: Click the button to scrape the content and generate embeddings.
6. **Ask a Question**: Input a question to retrieve relevant information from the processed content.
7. **Get Answer**: Click the button to generate an answer based on the retrieved context.
8. **Provide Feedback**: Optionally, provide feedback on the generated answer.

## Code Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `cache/`: Directory to store cached embeddings.

## Important Considerations

- **API Key**: Ensure you have a valid Gemini API key.
- **Chunk Size and Overlap**: Adjust these parameters based on the content length and structure.
- **Embedding Model Selection**: Experiment with different models to find the most suitable one.
- **Caching**: Cached embeddings are stored in the `cache/` directory to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: The app includes basic error handling for API responses.
- **Future Enhancements**: The code is structured to allow easy addition of features like multi-language support, security measures, and more.
